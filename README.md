## How to Install (PC / Android / iOS)

2. Launch Roblox and join any Jailbreak server
3. Open your executor interface
4. Click “Attach” / “Inject” to Roblox process
5. Copy the entire script from our GitHub page
6. Paste into executor and press **Execute**
7. Enjoy! GUI should appear instantly 🎉

### Android (Fluxus / Delta / Codex)
